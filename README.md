# News Website using only HTML, CSS and Javascript | Javascript Project

Created a News Website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance my front-end web development skills. This project allowed me to build a fully functional and visually appealing news platform without relying on any external frameworks or libraries.

I structured the content using HTML, styled the layout with CSS, and used JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamically fetch news articles from an API. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience with API integration, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of core web technologies and gave me practical insight into how to develop a complete website from scratch.
